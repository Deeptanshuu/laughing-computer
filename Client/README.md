- [x] Implement React Router for navigation between pages.
- [x] Set up state management (React Context or Redux) for the shopping cart.
- [x] Fetch product data from the backend API.
- [x] Implement features such as product search, filtering, and pagination.
- [ ] Implement user authentication (optional).
- [ ] Login and order history , 

### Shopping Cart Functionality:

- [x] Create a shopping cart component to display added items and their details.
- [x] Implement functionality to add and remove items from the cart.
- [x] Display the total price in the cart.

### Product Search and Filtering:

- [x] Add filters for categories, price range, etc.

### Checkout Process (Optional):

- [ ] If implemented, create a checkout process that collects necessary information for order placement.

### Inventory Management (Optional):

- [x] If implemented, track product availability and update the inventory.

### Responsive Design:

- [ ] Ensure the application is responsive using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or custom media queries.

### Testing:

- [ ] Write unit tests for backend and frontend code to ensure functionality.

### Documentation:

- [ ] Document the code thoroughly.
- [ ] Include setup instructions, API documentation, and any other relevant information.

### Deployment:

- [ ] Deploy the backend to a server (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
- [x] Deploy the frontend to a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

### Demo Video:

- [x] Create a demo video showcasing key features and functionality.










# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
